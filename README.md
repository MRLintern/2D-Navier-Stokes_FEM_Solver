# 2D-Navier-Stokes_FEM_Solver

## Introduction
A __Modern C++17 Solver__ which solves the ___2D Navier-Stokes Equations___ for a fluid flowing in a River/Open-Channel.
The __2D Navier-Stokes Equations__ are discretised via the __Finite Element Method__.
This is a work in progress.
## Requirements
* Developed on `Ubuntu 20.04`.
* __Compiler__: `g++ 13.1.0`.
* `Eigen Library`.
* `Catch2` for __Unit Testing__.

## Model Description
* The channel is a __2D Rectangular Region__, with __100 nodes__ in both the x- and y-direction, making a __1000 node domain__.
  
## Conjugate Gradient Method
* TODO.
  
## Getting and Running the Software
